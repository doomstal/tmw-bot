# tmw-bot
simple bot for The Mana World

currently it has no config file, so change bot's username/password in Net.java at lines 221-222

0. download luaj from http://www.luaj.org/luaj/3.0/README.html
1. create directory lib, and put luaj-jse-3.0.1.jar there
2. compile with `javac -cp "lib/luaj-jse-3.0.1.jar" *.java`
3. run with `java -cp "lib/luaj-jse-3.0.1.jar;." bot`

it's still in heavy development, so don't expect much from it ;)
